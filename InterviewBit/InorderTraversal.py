Inorder Traversal
=================

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodesâ€™ values.

Example :
Given binary tree

   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,3,2].

Using recursion is not allowed.

Solution
--------

Morris traversal uses O(1) extra space, works in O(N) time, generates inorder
tree traversal and leaves tree without change after work.
But during work it can change pointers to right child in some nodes.
